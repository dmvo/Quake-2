This directory contains files and other directories
that we either didn't want to keep in the source tree
but couldn't just throw away, or some old code that
was replaced by newer and better one.

The directory structure here reproduces that of the
source tree directory. For example, if we had a top
level `win32' directory, we'll have the Attic/win32
directory with exactly the same contents.
